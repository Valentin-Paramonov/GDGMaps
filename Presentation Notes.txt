1. Introduction
2. Google Maps
Google Maps is a mapping mobile app developed by Google for the Android and iOS operating systems; it uses Google Maps for its information. It was first released for Android on September 23, 2008, and later for iOS on December 13, 2012 as an alternative to Apple Maps, which was released with iOS 6.[1]

3. Google APIs
Google APIs is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) developed by Google which allow communication with Google Services and their integration to other services. Examples of these include Search, Gmail, Translate or Google Maps. Third-party apps can use these APIs to take advantage of or extend the functionality of the existing services.

4. Google Play Services
The way that Google APIs are delivered to user devices. Automatic updates. No need to upgrade and redeploy. Instant availability of new features.
With Google Play services, your app can take advantage of the latest, Google-powered features such as Maps, Google+, and more, with automatic platform updates distributed as an APK through the Google Play store. This makes it faster for your users to receive updates and easier for you to integrate the newest that Google has to offer.
Fused Location Provider
    GPS + Wifi + Cell + Sensors
    Power, Accuracy, Coverage
Geofencing
    Creating "fences" around objects of interest to react when the devices enters these fences
Activity Recognition (still, walking, bike, driving)
    Ability to listen to specific callbacks and react accordingly
    If you know the user is driving, you can zoom out and render more frequently
    Machine Learning was used to analyze sensor data

5. Google Maps
Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program designed by Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes Javascript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites,[1] and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world.

6. Google Maps API
With the Google Maps Android API, you can add maps based on Google Maps data to your application. The API automatically handles access to Google Maps servers, data downloading, map display, and response to map gestures. You can also use API calls to add markers, polygons, and overlays to a basic map, and to change the user's view of a particular map area. These objects provide additional information for map locations, and allow user interaction with the map. The API allows you to add these graphics to a map:
    Icons anchored to specific positions on the map (Markers).
    Sets of line segments (Polylines).
    Enclosed segments (Polygons).
    Bitmap graphics anchored to specific positions on the map (Ground Overlays).
    Sets of images which are displayed on top of the base map tiles (Tile Overlays).

4. Limitations of v1
GoogleMap was derived from Activity
Only one MapActivity is supported per process
One map at a time

5. What's new in v2
December 2012
Because maps are encapsulated in the MapFragment class, you can implement them by extending the Android standard Activity class, rather than extending the MapActivity used in version 1.
As many maps as you want
Everything is Parcelable
setIcon() (no need to swap markers)
Gestures are enabled by default
Indoor maps (
    can be switched off,
    support only one fragment at a time,
    all turn off, one - turn on,
    ability to change levels)
Camera
    Panning, zoom, tilt, bearing
    Vector maps
    3d buildings
    Animation
    Magic Camara
Better sensor integration

6. Map Fragment
7. Polylines
List of LatLng
8. Polygons
List of LatLng, enclosed, can have a fill
Cut-outs supported
Circles (center, radius [in meters])
9. Markers
Info windows that are fully customizable
Add custom views through InfoWindowAdapter
10. Camera Updates
moveCamera - straight to the point
animateCamera - smooth transition
Offset Camera Target (through android maps utils)

11. Places API
An HTTP service

12. Directions API

12. Limitations
Have to be on UI thread
No in-built animation (you have to do it yourself. Android's Property Animation Framework is a great help)

13. Pricing
Maps is free
Places API is free for 150,000 requests per day after credit card validation
Other - 2500/day free + $0.50 for each 1000 on top upto 100,000/day

13. Maps Utils
https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-utils
PolyUtils, SphericalUitls, BubbleIconFactory

Marker clustering — handles the display of a large number of points
Heat maps — display a large number of points as a heat map
IconGenerator — display text on your Markers (see screenshot to the right)
Poly decoding and encoding — compact encoding for paths, interoperability with Maps API web services
Spherical geometry — for example: computeDistance, computeHeading, computeArea
KML — displays KML data (Caution: Beta!)
GeoJSON — displays and styles GeoJSON data

Only additions to the map have to be on the UI thread
